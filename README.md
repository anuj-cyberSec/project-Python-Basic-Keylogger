**Keylogger Project**


**Description**
This is a simple Python keylogger project created using the pynput library. It logs keys pressed by the user and writes them to a file for tracking and monitoring purposes. It's essential to note that the use of keyloggers without proper authorization can be unethical and illegal. This project is intended for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly and with permission.


**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x

pynput library (Install using pip install pynput)

**Usage**

1.  Install the required dependencies:

    pip install pynput

2.  Run the script:

    python keylogger.py

3.  The keylogger will start listening to keyboard events.

4.  As the user presses keys, the keylogger logs them.

5.  When the number of logged keys reaches 10, they are written to a file named "log.txt" in the project directory.

6.  To stop the keylogger, press the 'esc' key. Please note that the 'esc' key is not case-sensitive.

**Configuration**

You can customize the keylogger to save the logged keys to a different file by modifying the write_file function.
